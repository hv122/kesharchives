This is the code used for my first year project which involved the design and programming of a webpage controlled rover, wherein the webpage would both control
the rover's movement, as well as received data on the aliens, measured with a range of different sensors.

In this project, I leant how back and front-end developers work together, and although I did not develop the back-end personally, I learnt about a whole host of
different methods with which we can host and communicate with webpages. Some of these included AJAX and WebSocket; I also discovered the differences, the advantages
and disadvantages of each method.
